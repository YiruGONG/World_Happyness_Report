Happiness is one of the most important feelings for human beings. In this project, we aimed to find out 
* what factors affect happiness. 
* In what way do these factors affect happiness. 
* How does COVID-19 affect happiness.
* How to increase happiness score.

## Data Distribution

To identify the significance of relationships and establish a regression model to predict the happiness score, we first take a look on the distribution of each variable.

```{r}
par(mfrow= c(3,3))
for (n in 3:ncol(happy_df)){
  var = names(happy_df)[n]
  pull(happy_df,n) %>% hist(main=var,xlab=var)
}
```

Here our response variable `lie_ladder` follows great bell shape and is relatively non-skewed. Most of the factors are normally distributed. Therefore we can proceed to build regression model.

## Linear regression model

Since all factors are continuous, we can apply fundamental linear regression here.

```{r}
# General Model
happy_fit = happy_df %>% 
  select(-country_name)
fit = happy_fit %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>% 
  lm(life_ladder~., data=.) %>% 
  broom.mixed::tidy()
knitr::kable(fit)
```

The result indicated that `r fit[-1,] %>% filter(p.value<0.05) %>% pull(term)` are all significantly correlated with happiness score, while `r fit[-1,] %>% filter(p.value>=0.05) %>% pull(term)` does not.

## Cross Validation

To test the model efficiency and its predictory ability, we apply 100 times of cross validation and calculate the mean value of root mean squared errors (RMSE) over 100 CVs.

```{r}
cv_df = crossv_mc(happy_fit, 100) %>% 
  mutate(train = map(train,as_tibble),
         test = map(test, as_tibble)) %>% 
  mutate(linear_mod = map(train, ~lm(life_ladder ~ ., data = .x)) ) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_linear = map2_dbl(linear_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)) )
```

```{r}
ggplot(cv_df,aes(x="linear",y=rmse_linear))+geom_violin()
mean_rmse = mean(pull(cv_df,rmse_linear))
mean_rmse
```

Here we can see the mean RMSE is `mean_rmse`, which is acceptable. Therefore, the model could be used to predict the country's happiness score.
