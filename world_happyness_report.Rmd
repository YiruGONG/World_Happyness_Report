The motivation for this project

We chose this dataset because we want to analyze what factors affect people's happiness scores. Factors that are included into our consideration are country, year, GDP, healthy life expectancy at birth, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. Our goal is to find out both direct and inverse relationships between people's heappiness and above factors.
